    review: "Really good coffee. Their iced latte is my go-to. They also have several speciality lattes. The service is always quick and friendly, even on the weekend when they are packed. Clean bathroom, too! I haven't tried their breakfast food items yet, but look forward to trying their food, too.",

    review: "I had the eggscape from New York and a chai, which were both delicious. the eggs were great and so was the fruit and the toast. The potatoes were good as well although it would've been nice to have some ketchup or some sauce with them. they were seasoned with rosemary, which was great, but could've used a bit of salt. it's a really cute cafÃ© and seems to have good space.
